## Want to contribute?

Gosh yes, thank you so much. [Do a pull request](https://github.com/good/openweb/pulls) or [file an issue](https://github.com/good/openweb/pulls) and I’ll add it. Easy peasy. And thank you.

## Where’d this come from? 

These kinds of things aren’t anything new, but the idea for this one came from a note that [Brent Simmons](https://inessential.com/) sent out to a Slack group, and I thought “Why not?” So I picked it up and ran with it.
